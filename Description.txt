Actually, the codebase mainly consists of two parts. The first part is the management of timeseries (indexes and in-memory data samples), and they are in folders except for leveldb. The second part is the management of the persistent data samples (I derive time-partitioned lsm tree based on LevelDB), which is contained in folder leveldb. For each folder, the main contents are as follows:

base: basic helper functions for the codebase
block: interfaces for chunk reader/writer, and index reader/writer
chunk: compression of a set of data points into a chunk
cloud: the AWS S3 wrapper for file operations on S3
db: the tsdb object (in charge of everything)
head: management of in-memory data (indexes and in-memory data samples), this is important
index: mainly are different kinds of posting lists
label: tags
leveldb: time-partitioned LSM tree
querier: the querier for all data, which has a global view (this is deprecated), the current querier is in leveldb/db/db_querier.h
Besides, you can read the blogs of Prometheus for some basic concepts.
